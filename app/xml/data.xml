<![CDATA[ <p data-pm-slice="0 0 []">Stars from pro wrestling and the world of bodybuilding have often crossed paths. WWE even inducted Arnold Schwarzenegger, a bodybuilding legend, into their Hall of Fame. Another bodybuilding legend who held more Mr. Olympia titles than Arnold had his fair share of interaction with WWE superstars.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pDns20FDhhw" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p> <p>Ronnie Coleman, who won the Mr. Olympia title 8-times in a row, has often appeared in the media alongside some famous WWE names.</p> <p>While bodybuilding has seen some of the best muscle men, WWE has had its own share of wrestlers with physiques to boast about. In his prime, WWE star Triple H had a ripe physique and was one of the most well-built wrestlers of his generation.</p> <p>A rare photo also shows Triple H nearly measuring up to Coleman in terms of biceps size.</p> <h2>Triple H and Ronnie Coleman flex their biceps in a rare photo</h2> <p><a href="https://www.essentiallysports.com/tag/ronnie-coleman/" rel="noopener">Ronnie Coleman</a> had a beefed-up physique and his domination in bodybuilding earned him the nickname ‘The King’.</p> <p>With his 23-inch biceps, Coleman had some of the biggest arms among athletes worldwide. But a rare photo has resurfaced, which shows the eight-time Mr. Olympia champion with WWE legend Triple H giving fans a chance to compare their biceps.</p> <p>READ MORE: <a href="https://www.essentiallysports.com/wwe-news-us-sports-bodybuilding-rare-photo-of-bodybuilding-legend-ronnie-coleman-flexing-with-wwe-legend-who-had-26-inch-biceps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Rare Photo of Bodybuilding Legend Ronnie Coleman Flexing With WWE Legend Who Had 26-Inch Biceps</strong></a></p> <p>Many WWE wrestlers in the past, like Hogan, have matched or even beaten the biceps size of bodybuilders like Arnold and Coleman. In this <a href="https://www.facebook.com/MuscleMeccaForums/photos/a.567714356680248/3367528673365455/?type=3&amp;theater" target="_blank" rel="noopener">photo</a>, Triple H can be seen almost matching up to the iconic bodybuilder, which is quite impressive.</p> <p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1242761" src="https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/Triple-H-coleman.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" srcset="https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/Triple-H-coleman.jpg 600w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/Triple-H-coleman-473x315.jpg 473w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/Triple-H-coleman-225x150.jpg 225w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/Triple-H-coleman-370x247.jpg 370w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/Triple-H-coleman-20x13.jpg 20w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/Triple-H-coleman-185x123.jpg 185w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/Triple-H-coleman-400x267.jpg 400w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/Triple-H-coleman-150x100.jpg 150w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/Triple-H-coleman-72x48.jpg 72w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p> <p>And while Coleman is a full-fledged bodybuilder, Triple H gave him a run for his money when comparing biceps. Both Triple H and Coleman have been legends in their industries and inspired a million others across the world.</p> <p>Interestingly, Triple H was featured in a segment with another bodybuilding legend, Arnold Schwarzenegger, on an episode of SmackDown in 1999. On the show, McMahon presented the &#8220;World Box Office Championship&#8221; to Arnold, who then laid out Triple H after a few punches.</p> <h2>Coleman&#8217;s numerous surgeries</h2> <p data-pm-slice="1 1 []">The impressive bodybuilding career of Ronnie Coleman took its toll on him. He has had to deal with many significant injuries to his spine and hip. All these injuries have required extensive surgical procedures and Coleman has gone under the knife 13-times to date.</p> <p>Moreover, he has had 14 screws, two rods, and two cages fitted inside his body as of today. During these times, he endured many painful moments, including the time when the screws broke inside him <a href="https://www.essentiallysports.com/us-sports-news-bodybuilding-news-it-shattered-my-whole-body-ronnie-coleman-recalls-unbearable-four-times-the-screws-broke-inside-his-body-despite-spending-over-2-million-on-his-surgery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four times</a>.</p> <p>Despite all the surgeries and doctors’ advice, Coleman continues to train regularly in the gym, keeping his body fit, and that is one reason many have so much admiration for him.</p> <p>Watch This Story: <a href="https://www.essentiallysports.com/stories/us-sports-news-mr-olympia-legends-arnold-schwarzenegger-vs-ronnie-coleman-body-comparison/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mr. Olympia legends Arnold Schwarzenegger vs Ronnie Coleman body comparison</a></p> <p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.essentiallysports.com/wwe-bodybuilding-news-decades-old-rare-photo-of-ronnie-coleman-shows-triple-h-giving-him-a-run-for-his-money-with-equally-big-biceps/">Decades-old Rare Photo of Ronnie Coleman Shows Triple H Giving Him a Run for His Money With Equally Big Biceps</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.essentiallysports.com">EssentiallySports</a>.</p> ]]>

<![CDATA[ <p>Daniel Ricciardo hasn&#8217;t had a good stint with McLaren. While the 2021 season was arguably bad, 2022 got worse. But finally, the Honey Badger can breathe a sigh of relief after securing a P5 at the Singapore Grand Prix.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SgchybSwl9c" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p> <p>It was all set to be another gloomy evening for Ricciardo. He was starting the race in P16, which is never ideal. But the rain did what rain does best in Formula One. It brought in excitement. From a starting grid of 20 drivers, only 14 finished the race. And for a change, Daniel Ricciardo was on the good side of luck.</p> <h2>Daniel Ricciardo credits teamwork for good results in Singapore</h2> <p>In lap 36, Yuki Tsunoda crashed into the barriers, prompting Safety Car to be deployed. This is when <a href="https://www.essentiallysports.com/tag/max-verstappen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Max Verstappen</a> was lurking behind <a href="https://www.essentiallysports.com/tag/lando-norris/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lando Norris</a>, who was in P4 at the time. Anticipating that the Safety Car had gone in, Max lunged forward, trying to overtake Norris but quickly locked up as he saw that the flags hadn&#8217;t gone green.</p> <p>With his tires locked up, he went into the run-off area, rejoining the track at P8. Ricciardo took advantage of the situation and got himself into P5, the position he held on till the end of the race.</p> <figure id="attachment_925094" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-925094" style="width: 1920px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-925094" src="https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-1339845077.jpg" alt="McLaren F1 team in Monza" width="1920" height="1280" srcset="https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-1339845077.jpg 1920w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-1339845077-473x315.jpg 473w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-1339845077-225x150.jpg 225w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-1339845077-768x512.jpg 768w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-1339845077-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-1339845077-370x247.jpg 370w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-1339845077-800x533.jpg 800w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-1339845077-20x13.jpg 20w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-1339845077-185x123.jpg 185w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-1339845077-740x493.jpg 740w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-1339845077-400x267.jpg 400w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-1339845077-1600x1067.jpg 1600w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-1339845077-150x100.jpg 150w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-1339845077-72x48.jpg 72w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-925094" class="wp-caption-text">MONZA, ITALY &#8211; SEPTEMBER 12: Lando Norris of McLaren and Great Britain, Zac Brown of USA and Mclaren and Daniel Ricciardo of Australia and McLaren during the F1 Grand Prix of Italy at Autodromo di Monza on September 12, 2021 in Monza, Italy.

However, the franchise did not limit itself to making games as it ventured into the amusement park industry with Super Nintendo World. But does that mean that the Japanese took a pit stop? Well, it doesn&#8217;t look like it has, as it has now launched its website Nintendo Pictures Co.

<![CDATA[ <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Major League Baseball is about to enter the postseason, and eleven teams have already qualified for the playoffs. Therefore, just one spot is left. That spot will likely get filled by the Philadelphia Phillies. But the team, San Francisco Giants, which everyone thought would give a tremendous season this year as well, got eliminated.</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e6ecRzLixvg" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p> <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Giants entered this season with the highest expectations after they got more than 100 wins last season. But, in Sunday&#8217;s game at Oracle Park, after the Giants lost to the Diamondbacks, they got eliminated from the playoffs. Fans of the team were left disappointed by their team&#8217;s struggle this season after a mind-blowing last season with 100+ wins. </span></p> <h2><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The tremendous season of the San Francisco Giants led the fans to high expectations</span></h2> <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Giants are left with less than five games this regular season. However, if the team does not win all of them, they will be making history. Not because of something good but by becoming the 7th team in the history of Major League Baseball to give a losing season after a 100-win season. They entered this season with high expectations after winning a franchise-record 107 games in 2021. </span></p> <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Dear <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SFGiants?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SFGiants</a> fans, <a href="https://t.co/DMSFhx4FKT">pic.twitter.com/DMSFhx4FKT</a></p> <p>&mdash; SFGiants (@SFGiants) <a href="https://twitter.com/SFGiants/status/1576750130002272258?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2022</a></p></blockquote> <p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p> <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">On the other hand, after getting the elimination confirmed on Saturday, the Giants&#8217; official Twitter handle posted a heartfelt apology thanking the fans for standing by them in the difficult times. </span></p> <p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a class="jsx-555d36b3e6439572 article-embed-title" href="https://www.essentiallysports.com/mlb-baseball-news-old-man-rocks-ufc-star-joins-the-mlb-world-in-mocking-wild-boat-moment-during-a-san-francisco-giants-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Old Man Rocks!” – UFC Star Joins the MLB World in Mocking Wild Boat Moment During a San Francisco Giants Game</a></p> <p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Giants that won 107 games last season could not even cross 90 this year, while they lost 79.

<![CDATA[ <p>Michael Jordan took his exit from the court in 2003. After having a stellar NBA career of 15 seasons, His Airness finally called it quits at the age of 40. MJ had earlier announced his retirement twice in 1993 and 1999, but he always found his way back to the court. During his final game with the Washington Wizards, Jordan scored 15 points, four rebounds and four assists against the Philadelphia 76ers. However, the Wizards lost to the Sixers by 107-87.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tw14LG80vZ0?start=50" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p> <p>When Jordan exited the court after fouling, he received standing ovations from the fans and coaches. Even the remaining players on the court, including the opponents, applauded while Jordan basked in the love and respect on his final night as an NBA player. Evidently, MJ put an end to his basketball career as the third-highest total score in the league&#8217;s history with 32,292 points. He was only behind NBA legends Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Karl Malone.</p> <p><strong>READ MORE &#8211; </strong><a href="https://www.essentiallysports.com/nba-basketball-news-young-lil-wayne-sported-iconic-michael-jordan-jersey-way-before-achieving-stardom-in-rare-image/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Young Lil Wayne Sported Iconic Michael Jordan Jersey Way Before Achieving Stardom in Rare Image</strong></a></p> <p>Two years after his retirement, the former <a href="https://www.essentiallysports.com/category/nba/chicago-bulls/">Chicago Bulls</a> player launched his book <em>Driven From Within</em>.

After having constantly lived under the spotlight for a long time, MJ expressed his desire to have a more private life now that he has retired. Furthermore, while talking about the sport, Jordan said that the state of basketball was not as good as it used to be. He felt that the new generation of NBA players were being paid more than they deserved, which affected the sport and the players&#8217; ethics.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EEHAtJ3cIUk?start=799" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p> <p><em>&#8220;The kids today, they are being given things that they haven&#8217;t earned.

The Hollywood actress once revealed how Agassi&#8217;s rage overcame him after watching her shoot a scene.</span></p> <h2><b>Brooke Shields on Andre Agassi’s angry side</b></h2> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The 57-year-old star once shared an incident where Agassi had expressed displeasure with her performance in a F.R.I.E.N.D.S episode involving Matt LeBlanc. She said, <em>“Andre visited the soundstage to watch me shoot my Friends scene,”</em> and continued that her then husband left the shoot after she played the scene where her character <em>“a crazed fan who begins licking Joey’s fingers”</em>.</span></p> <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She further </span><a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/brooke-shields-andre-agassi-stormed-set-during-friends-appearance.html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">spoke</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> about Andre Agassi losing his cool and trying to break his trophies by saying, “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon arrival, he systematically smashed and destroyed every single trophy he had won, Including Wimbledon and the U.S. Open, never mind all the others. It took me three years to have them all replaced.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”</span></p> <figure id="attachment_1147288" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1147288" style="width: 1920px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img loading="lazy" class="wp-image-1147288 size-full" src="https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-807473430.jpg" alt="Andre Agassi" width="1920" height="1280" srcset="https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-807473430.jpg 1920w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-807473430-473x315.jpg 473w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-807473430-225x150.jpg 225w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-807473430-768x512.jpg 768w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-807473430-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-807473430-370x247.jpg 370w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-807473430-800x533.jpg 800w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-807473430-20x13.jpg 20w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-807473430-185x123.jpg 185w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-807473430-740x493.jpg 740w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-807473430-400x267.jpg 400w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-807473430-1600x1067.jpg 1600w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-807473430-150x100.jpg 150w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-807473430-72x48.jpg 72w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1147288" class="wp-caption-text">Andre Agassi watches Novak Djokovic as he practices on day two of the Wimbledon Championships at The All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, Wimbledon.

Although her marriage to Agassi took her away from her overbearing parents, she mentioned how she felt being controlled by the legendary tennis player at times. Brookes went on to discuss her ex-husband&#8217;s drug problem and sympathized with him, considering the hectic schedule of tennis players.

I was second and had to restart 22nd on that restart.&#8221; </em></p> <p><em>&#8220;So we lost a ton of spots, and we were only able to get back to 10th.

Fortunately, he is still in Playoff contention, and he was able to deliver a better result at Talladega on Sunday.</p> <p>To be precise, the #11 driver finished in 5th place, behind Chase Elliott, Ryan Blaney, Michael McDowell, and Ross Chastain. It is also interesting to note that he did entertain the idea of enacting immediate revenge.</p> <figure id="attachment_1242717" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1242717" style="width: 1920px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-1242717" src="https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-1428106330-1.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1281" srcset="https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-1428106330-1.jpg 1920w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-1428106330-1-472x315.jpg 472w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-1428106330-1-225x150.jpg 225w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-1428106330-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-1428106330-1-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-1428106330-1-370x247.jpg 370w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-1428106330-1-800x534.jpg 800w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-1428106330-1-20x13.jpg 20w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-1428106330-1-185x123.jpg 185w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-1428106330-1-740x494.jpg 740w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-1428106330-1-400x267.jpg 400w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-1428106330-1-1600x1068.jpg 1600w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-1428106330-1-150x100.jpg 150w, https://image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-1428106330-1-72x48.jpg 72w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" /><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1242717" class="wp-caption-text">FORT WORTH, TEXAS &#8211; SEPTEMBER 25: Denny Hamlin, driver of the #11 FedEx Office Toyota, stands on the grid prior to the NASCAR Cup Series Auto Trader EchoPark Automotive 500 at Texas Motor Speedway on September 25, 2022 in Fort Worth, Texas.

<![CDATA[ <p>LeBron James has created a legacy that will be difficult for anybody to surpass. In a few years, an era will come to an end, when LeBron will retire from the game. But at the same time, his son, Bronny James, will make his appearance in the big leagues and hope to carry on his father&#8217;s legacy. However, Bronny will have a lot to prove, having inherited his father&#8217;s genetic code and teachings.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="YouTube video player" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GSTDP88Eu6I" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p> <p>For a very long time, Bronny has been surrounded by accusations of nepotism, which is common with all star kids.

Bronny has some skills in him like his father. He can shoot and pass better than most of the kids his age.</p> <p>The 17-year-old is said to be on the radar of several NBA franchises.
